# VGA_controller_pwm
VGA driver with PIC21FJ64GA004 &amp; PmodVGA module

#System clock
The MCU runs on 8 MHz Primary Oscillator, with PLL enabled to achieve a 32 MHz (Fosc) internal clock. With 16 MIPS @ 32 MHz, this gives an actual clock frequency of 16 MHz.
# Timer
Timer 2 is setup as follows:
* Clock source: Fosc / 2
* Input frequency: 16 MHz
* Prescaler: 1:1
* Bit mode: 16 bit
* Timer Period:
* * Timer period:31.8 us
  * Calculated period: 31.8125 us
* Timer interrupt enabled

# HSYNC
The Horizontal sync-signal is generated by an output compare module to generate a PWM signal every 31.778 us.
